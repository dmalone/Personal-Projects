Model description       : 

	It's the little green dinosaur from all those great Super Mario,
	and Yoshi games published by Nintendo!

	The names Super Mario and Yoshi are registered trademarks of 
	Nintendo Corp. and all of their	affiliates.  Names, images, likenesses, and
	sounds included with this model are the sole property of Nintendo, and 
	I claim no ownership to any of them.  

Other info              : 
	Well I started working on Yoshi months ago, mostly finished it, and
	never released it, so I loaded it up and made sure it works in DM, and
	it seems to work fine.  Nintendo will be happy to know that I made Yoshi
	as anti-gore as possible so he doesn't go to pieces during any of my death 
	animations.  I had a lot of fun with the taunts and stuff so check them out.
	The skins suck, as does the skin mapping.  I'm much better at skin mapping now,
	but at the time I made this I did what I could.  Plus I didn't have a REAL 
	skin artist to do the skin, so I had to whip it out myself!  However, he's 
	never shaded in any of the Nintendo games he's in, so he doesn't look too 
	bad.

Thanks to               :
	All the people that make freeware 3dstudio plugins that would have made
	Yoshi possible in a week instead of several weeks.  Keep up the good work!
