	           hunt down and destroy all Jedi.  Ordered by Emperor Palpatine to kill
	           Luke Skywalker, but tried to save his son instead.

Other info  :      Darth Vader is the second model that I make.  It's a brand new model, with a 
                          Light-Saber, that I made with the software TrueSpace4.  Just for the head, I 
                          used 240 polygons because I wanted it to be the more realistic possible, in 
                          spite of a less detailed body.  For the Light-Saber I used a game bug to give 
                          a halo look to the blade : I just inverted the mapped side of some polygons.  
                          For doing the animations I used QME because TrueSpace4 doesn't work fine with 
                          Low-polys animatable deformations.  I tried the best I could, with my little 
                          animations experience, to give a tissue look to the cape, I like the result.   
                          For the skin, I used the software CorelPhotoPaint8, and some pictures of the 
                          SciFiUniverse of November 1995 and StarWarsInsider Issue #26 magazines, courtesy
                          of my friend Kaarde, pictures that I scanned and pasted on the skin.  I think 
                          that the result is pretty cool, since I wanted to keep the original look of the 
                          character.  Same thing for the saber, I used a picture that I found on the 
                          "StarWars 3d Modeling Alliance" web site http://www.surfthe.net/swma/archives/archives.html.
                          I mapped the skin with NST. I confess that the skin isn't well mapped.  I used 
                          only the necessary parts of Vader.  I also cheated a bit by stretching the two 
                          polys of the back in the only goal to have 0% of skin waste.  I used Q2modeler 
                          to solve the "NULL skin found" problem.
